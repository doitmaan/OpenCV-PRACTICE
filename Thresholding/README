otsu and riddler-calvard
Another way we can automatically compute the threshold
value of T is to use Otsu’s method.
Otsu’s method assumes there are two peaks in the grayscale
histogram of the image. It then tries to find an optimal
value to separate these two peaks – thus our value of T.
While OpenCV provides support for Otsu’s method,  the implementation by Luis Pedro Coelho in the mahotas
package since it is more Pythonic.
