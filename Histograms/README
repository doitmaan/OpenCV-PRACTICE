cv2.calcHist(images,channels,mask,histSize,ranges)
1. images: This is the image that we want to compute a
histogram for. Wrap it as a list: [myImage].
2. channels: This is a list of indexes, where we specify
the index of the channel we want to compute a histogram
for. To compute a histogram of a grayscale
image, the list would be [0]. To compute a histogram
for all three red, green, and blue channels, the channels
list would be [0,1,2].
3. mask: here we can supply a mask. If a mask is
provided, a histogram will be computed for masked
pixels only. If we do not have a mask or do not want
to apply one, we can just provide a value of None.
4. histSize: This is the number of bins we want to use
when computing a histogram. Again, this is a list, one
for each channel we are computing a histogram for.
The bin sizes do not all have to be the same. Here is
an example of 32 bins for each channel: [32,32,32].

5. ranges: Here we specify The range of possible pixel
values. Normally, this is [0, 256] for each channel, but
if you are using a color space other than RGB (such as
HSV), the ranges might be different.
